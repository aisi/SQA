Software quality assurance (SQA) consists of a means of monitoring the software engineering processes and methods used to
ensure quality. The methods by which this is accomplished are many and varied, and may include ensuring conformance to one
or more standards, such as ISO 9000 or a model such as CMMI.

SQA encompasses the entire software development process, which includes processes such as requirements definition,
software design, coding, source code control, code reviews, software configuration management, testing, release management,
and product integration. SQA is organized into goals, commitments, abilities, activities, measurements, and verifications.

SQA is an ongoing process within the software development life cycle that routinely checks the developed software to ensure it meets desired quality measures.

QA is earlier ones desirable(lower cost) but may not be feasible by testing and many others with QA classification.
QA including preventing fault injection, removal of faults, failure prevention and containment. The methods are as followings: defect prevention, inspection, testing, fault tolerance, safety assurance and so on.
