###Software testing is the use of manual or automatic means to run or test a system process , which aims to test whether it satisfies specified requirements or expected results to ascertain the difference between the actual results , which is developed to help identify (middle or the final version ) computer software ( in whole or in part ) the accuracy (correctness), complete degrees (completeness) and quality (quality) of the software process ; are SQA (software quality assurance) is an important sub- domains.Software testing are the following major principles:
####1. All tests should be traced back to user needs. Well-known software testing aims to prompt an error , and the most serious errors are those that lead to errors in the program can not meet demand .
####2 . In the period before the implementation of the test should be carried out test plan design . Testing program in the early start of the project , which can effectively avoid the part of the risk , and can effectively control the entire process , and thus play a role in quality assurance .
####3 . Test is not exhaustive testing. When the test should be carried out to a certain extent, stop the test , if the test go on indefinitely , it will be a waste of resources .
####4 . Testing should be sufficiently comprehensive . In order to ensure the stability and robustness of the system , the range covered by test cases designed to be as wide , test data covered the entire surface as possible .
####5. In order to achieve the best results , the best test conducted by an independent third party . Try to avoid testing done by the programmer , and programmers in the testing phase to avoid testing their own procedures. Testers and programmers by different personnel.
####6. According to the level found in the wrong time to determine the test stops and standards .Software testing and development process model can be represented by W , W model emphasizes : Testing With the entire software development cycle, but the test is not only the procedures , requirements, design, etc. Also to be tested , ie, testing and development is simultaneously. W model is conducive to the discovery of the problem as soon as possible overall . For example , the needs analysis is completed , the tester should be involved in the demand for the verification and validation activities in order to find out where the problem lies as soon as possible . Meanwhile , demand for testing also helps to keep abreast of difficulty and test risk , early development of response measures , which will significantly reduce overall test time , accelerate the project schedule . The following is the W model diagram : ![image](https://github.com/aisi/SQA/blob/master/1.png)
